These files are the R codes (maybe sometimes they won't be codes) I had for my statistics courses.
For HW 1, I learnt the basic structure and codes in R, such as how to create vectors and dataframes or how to extract data from lists.
Also, I got to know some codes and rules that would probably appear in lots of the codings, such as filtering and looping.

For HW 2, I used several library such as dplyr and dslabs. Those librarys allow me to view dataframes and to filter out data easily, such as using pipe %>%.
The codes that I got most impression were codes in checking dataframes, such as str(), filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize(), etc. 
With these functions, it's easier to evaluate data.

Then, I learnt to use ggplot to make visualizations of data in boxplot, scatter points, line graph, etc. It provides me flexible approaches to show the data.

The fourth assignment didn't need to write codes, but I leant the basic knowledge of probability and different theories and formulas to calculate different probabilities.
