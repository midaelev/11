These files are the R codes (maybe sometimes they won't be codes) I had for my statistics courses.
For HW 1, I learnt the basic structure and codes in R, such as how to create vectors and dataframes or how to extract data from lists.
Also, I got to know some codes and rules that would probably appear in lots of the codings, such as filtering and looping.

For HW 2, I used several library such as dplyr and dslabs. Those librarys allow me to view dataframes and to filter out data easily, such as using pipe %>%.
The codes that I got most impression were codes in checking dataframes, such as str(), filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize(), etc. 
With these functions, it's easier to evaluate data.

Then, I learnt to use ggplot to make visualizations of data in boxplot, scatter points, line graph, etc. It provides me flexible approaches to show the data.
